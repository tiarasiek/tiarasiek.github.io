           <h2>Bio</h2>
            
            <p>My name is Tiara Siek and I am a senior at Eastern Washington University. My major is Visual Communication Design and I am planning to apply to the BFA in Visual Communication Design this spring.</p>
            
            <p>Though I'm a senior, this is only my second year here at EWU. I went to high school in Newport, WA which is where I earned my AA degree by the time I graduated high school through SFCC and SCC's Running Start program. I basically started at Eastern as both a junior and a freshman. </p>
            
            <p>My main goal post-degree is to start a career in the design field, though I now could see myself taking great interest in web design as well after this class. Seeing as I have strong interest in the field of traditional art as well, I would hope I could find an opportunity that allows me to utilize these skills as well in the future.</p>
